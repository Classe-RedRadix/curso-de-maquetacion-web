                            Temperatures have been 30 to 40 degrees higher than usual in that
                            typically temperate area. Heat records across the Pacific
                            Northwest are being broken — not by a degree or two, but by four
                            or five. Canada saw the highest temperature ever recorded anywhere
                            in the country.

                            local authorities have relaxed covid-19 rules to pack more people
                            into cooling centers. Heat deaths have spiked. The heat wave’s
                            effects on wildfires and agriculture may not yet be fully visible.
                            Cherry growers are rushing to harvest their crop before it
                            shrivels in the sun — but stopping their picking at lunchtime to
                            avoid the baking heat. Vegetation may dry out more than usual,
                            creating tinderbox-like conditions.

                            This is all occurring before July, the month in which cities such
                            as Seattle had previously recorded rare triple-digit temperature
                            readings. It also appears to reflect a dangerous underlying trend;
                            extreme heat days have doubled in the area in less than a
                            century.Experts project that the number will continue to spike
                            over the coming decades. Nor has the perilous weather been
                            contained in the Northwest. Areas across the western United States
                            have seen new temperature records set this year. Drought is also
                            punishing the West.

                            Restoring and protecting beaver and wolf populations and reducing
                            cattle grazing across large tracts of the western United States
                            could be a big part of meeting President Joe Biden’s goal of
                            conserving at least 30 percent of the country’s lands, lakes and

                            aridification, a team of 20 scientists concluded in a paper

                            An expanded wolf population would thin out herds of elk and deer
                            that hamper forest regeneration when they browse on tender young
                            trees. Beavers would modulate flows along streams and rivers by
                            building dams that create areas of spongy soil that absorb water
                            during heavy rains and release it back slowly in drier times.

                            Both species were nearly wiped out as Europeans invaded North
                            America and settlers moved westward, but they are making a slow
                            comeback despite some social and political resistance. The new
                            paper proposes to speed the process by creating a
                            193,000-square-mile rewilding network spanning parts of 11 western
                            states where re-establishing those two species would spur a
                            self-reinforcing chain of bio-climate feedbacks.
