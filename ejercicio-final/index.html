				<p class="noTop">With all the resources practically exhausted on Earth, this year dozens of robotic expeditions have sent to find new resources on other planets. Only an expedition of three robots have survived.</p>
				<p>They are the last hope that humanity has to obtain the precious resources that will guarantee our survival on Earth.</p>

					<p class="newspaper__fontstyle_poppings_special_text">Temperatures have been 30 to 40 degrees higher than usual in that typically temperate area. Heat records across the Pacific Northwest are being broken — not by a degree or two, but by four or five. Canada saw the highest temperature ever recorded anywhere in the country.</p>
					<p>Hotels with air-conditioned rooms are booked solid. State and local authorities have relaxed covid-19 rules to pack more people into cooling centers. Heat deaths have spiked. The heat wave’s effects on wildfires and agriculture may not yet be fully visible. Cherry growers are rushing to harvest their crop before it shrivels in the sun — but stopping their picking at lunchtime to avoid the baking heat. Vegetation may dry out more than usual, creating tinderbox-like conditions.</p>
					<p>This is all occurring before July, the month in which cities such as Seattle had previously recorded rare triple-digit temperature readings. It also appears to reflect a dangerous underlying trend; extreme heat days have doubled in the area in less than a century.Experts project that the number will continue to spike over the coming decades. Nor has the perilous weather been contained in the Northwest. Areas across the western United States have seen new temperature records set this year. Drought is also punishing the West.</p>

				<h2 class="newspaper__seventh-article-title newspaper__fontstyle_poppings_title">Can Wolves and Beavers Help Save the West From Global Warming?</h2>
				<div class="newspaper__seventh-article-text newspaper__fontstyle_poppings_text">
					<p>Restoring and protecting beaver and wolf populations and reducing cattle grazing across large tracts of the western United States could be a big part of meeting President Joe Biden’s goal of conserving at least 30 percent of the country’s lands, lakes and rivers by 2030, a new study suggests.</p>
					<p>Both animals are keystone species that help shape the landscapes they live in, and bringing them back in a big way could help forests and streams struggling to adapt to rising temperatures and aridification, a team of 20 scientists concluded in a paper published Tuesday in the journal BioScience.</p>
					<p>An expanded wolf population would thin out herds of elk and deer that hamper forest regeneration when they browse on tender young trees. Beavers would modulate flows along streams and rivers by building dams that create areas of spongy soil that absorb water during heavy rains and release it back slowly in drier times.</p>
					<p>Both species were nearly wiped out as Europeans invaded North America and settlers moved westward, but they are making a slow comeback despite some social and political resistance. The new paper proposes to speed the process by creating a 193,000-square-mile rewilding network spanning parts of 11 western states where re-establishing those two species would spur a self-reinforcing chain of bio-climate feedbacks.</p>

					<p class="noTop">NASA will hold a trio of media teleconferences the week of Aug. 14 to preview the science and technology payloads that will fly as part of the agency’s Artemis I flight test. NASA also will provide livestream coverage of Artemis I’s move to the launch pad ahead of its targeted no earlier than Monday Aug. 29 liftoff.</p>
					<p>Artemis I is an uncrewed flight test, the first in a series of increasingly complex missions to the Moon. Through Artemis, NASA will land the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon, paving the way for a long-term lunar presence and serving as a steppingstone to send astronauts to Mars.</p>
					<p>Ten shoebox-size secondary payloads, called CubeSats, are hitching a ride to space on Artemis I’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, and several other investigations are flying inside the Orion spacecraft during the flight test. Each of the payloads will perform science and technology experiments in deep space, expanding understanding of lunar science, technology developments, and deep space radiation.</p>
					<p>The agency is targeting Thursday, Aug. 18 to roll the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft to NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Pad 39B in Florida.</p>
