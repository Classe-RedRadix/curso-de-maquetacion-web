                            have

                            to find new resources on other planets. Only an expedition of three robots have

                        <p>They are the last hope that humanity has to obtain the precious resources that will guarantee

                            five.

                            on
                            wildfires and agriculture may not yet be fully visible. Cherry growers are rushing to

                            rare triple-digit temperature readings. It also appears to reflect a dangerous underlying
                            trend;
                            extreme heat days have doubled in the area in less than a century.Experts project that the

                            will continue to spike over the coming decades. Nor has the perilous weather been contained
                            in
                            the
                            Northwest. Areas across the western United States have seen new temperature records set this
                            year.
