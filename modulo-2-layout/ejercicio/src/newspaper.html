                  With all the resources practically exhausted on Earth, this
                  year dozens of robotic expeditions have sent to find new
                  resources on other planets. Only an expedition of three robots
                  have survived.

                  They are the last hope that humanity has to obtain the
                  precious resources that will guarantee our survival on Earth.

              Temperatures have been 30 to 40 degrees higher than usual in that
              typically temperate area. Heat records across the Pacific
              Northwest are being broken — not by a degree or two, but by four
              or five. Canada saw the highest temperature ever recorded anywhere
              in the country.

              Hotels with air-conditioned rooms are booked solid. State and
              local authorities have relaxed covid-19 rules to pack more people
              into cooling centers. Heat deaths have spiked. The heat wave’s
              effects on wildfires and agriculture may not yet be fully visible.
              Cherry growers are rushing to harvest their crop before it
              shrivels in the sun — but stopping their picking at lunchtime to
              avoid the baking heat. Vegetation may dry out more than usual,
              creating tinderbox-like conditions.

              This is all occurring before July, the month in which cities such
              as Seattle had previously recorded rare triple-digit temperature
              readings. It also appears to reflect a dangerous underlying trend;
              extreme heat days have doubled in the area in less than a
              century.Experts project that the number will continue to spike
              over the coming decades. Nor has the perilous weather been
              contained in the Northwest. Areas across the western United States
              have seen new temperature records set this year. Drought is also
              punishing the West.

              Can Wolves and Beavers Help Save the West From Global Warming?
            </h3>
          </header>
          <main class="contentArticle">
            <p>
              Restoring and protecting beaver and wolf populations and reducing
              cattle grazing across large tracts of the western United States
              could be a big part of meeting President Joe Biden’s goal of
              conserving at least 30 percent of the country’s lands, lakes and
              rivers by 2030, a new study suggests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both animals are keystone species that help shape the landscapes
              they live in, and bringing them back in a big way could help
              forests and streams struggling to adapt to rising temperatures and
              aridification, a team of 20 scientists concluded in a paper
              published Tuesday in the journal BioScience.
            </p>
            <p>
              An expanded wolf population would thin out herds of elk and deer
              that hamper forest regeneration when they browse on tender young
              trees. Beavers would modulate flows along streams and rivers by
              building dams that create areas of spongy soil that absorb water
              during heavy rains and release it back slowly in drier times.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both species were nearly wiped out as Europeans invaded North
              America and settlers moved westward, but they are making a slow
              comeback despite some social and political resistance. The new
              paper proposes to speed the process by creating a
              193,000-square-mile rewilding network spanning parts of 11 western
              states where re-establishing those two species would spur a
              self-reinforcing chain of bio-climate feedbacks.

              NASA will hold a trio of media teleconferences the week of Aug. 14
              to preview the science and technology payloads that will fly as
              part of the agency’s Artemis I flight test. NASA also will provide
              livestream coverage of Artemis I’s move to the launch pad ahead of
              its targeted no earlier than Monday Aug. 29 liftoff.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artemis I is an uncrewed flight test, the first in a series of
              increasingly complex missions to the Moon. Through Artemis, NASA
              will land the first woman and the first person of color on the
              Moon, paving the way for a long-term lunar presence and serving as
              a steppingstone to send astronauts to Mars.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ten shoebox-size secondary payloads, called CubeSats, are hitching
              a ride to space on Artemis I’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket,
              and several other investigations are flying inside the Orion
              spacecraft during the flight test. Each of the payloads will
              perform science and technology experiments in deep space,
              expanding understanding of lunar science, technology developments,
              and deep space radiation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The agency is targeting Thursday, Aug. 18 to roll the Space Launch
              System and Orion spacecraft to NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Launch
              Pad 39B in Florida.
